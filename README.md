## Business Problem 
Here is my summary of the business I'm trying to solve.  Jelly Inc is interested in determining why customers are cancelling their subscriptions to Jam TV Services.  They are especially interested in the following: 

- What region of customers are cancelling their subscriptions the most
- Is there a relationship between streaming service plan type and cancellations
- Will promotions help them retain customers
